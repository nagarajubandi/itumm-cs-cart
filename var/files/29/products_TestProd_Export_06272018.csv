It has culinary as well as therapeutic uses.</p><p>Mustard oil has been used for centuries as a food additive, miracle cure-all and even an aphrodisiac. And even though its prodigious claims may not have held up, mustard oil remains a common diet staple in India and Bangladesh. The oil is made from crushed or pressed mustard seeds, and can be purchased at almost any Indian grocery store. Mustard oil has had a tumultuous history -- at one point even being thought of as toxic to humans -- but it's beginning to enter the mainstream as an accepted health food.</p><p><strong>Skin Benefits of Mustard oil</strong></p><ul><li dir=""ltr"">Removes Tan And Dark Spots</li><li dir=""ltr"">Lightens The Skin Tone</li><li dir=""ltr"">Natural Sunscreen</li><li dir=""ltr"">Treats Rashes And Infections</li><li dir=""ltr"">Has Anti-Aging Effects</li></ul><p><strong>Hair Benefits of Mustard Oil</strong></p><ul><li dir=""ltr"">Stimulates Hair Growth</li><li dir=""ltr"">Prevents Premature Graying</li><li dir=""ltr"">Gets Rid Of Dandruff And Itchy Scalp</li></ul><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>More Product Details</strong></p><p><strong>1. Cardiac Health<br></strong>Incorporating mustard oil into your diet may help protect against heart disease, according to a study in the April 2004 issue of the ""American Journal of Clinical Nutrition."" The oil is rich in monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats, both of which help lower bad cholesterol and raise good cholesterol. Improving your cholesterol balance will also help lower triglycerides, or blood fat levels, which can in turn prevent obesity, kidney disease, and hyperthyroidism, in addition to improving heart health.<br><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>2. Anti-Bacterial<br></strong>Mustard oil is thought to work as an antibacterial agent when taken both internally and externally, and as an antifungal when used externally. Internally, it can fight bacteria infections in the colon, intestines, and other parts of the digestive tract. Externally, it can treat both bacterial and fungal infections when applied directly to the skin. In fact, researchers from the Armed Forces Institute, reporting in the October 2004 issue of the ""Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons"" state that a 1 to 1 mixture of honey and mustard oil is effective at killing dental bacteria and may be useful in root canal treatments.<br><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>3. Skin Benefits<br></strong>Mustard oil is often applied externally, especially during massages. The oil has high levels of vitamin E, which helps improve skin health. It can help protect the skin against free radicals from ultraviolet light and pollution, and can even help reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles. Additionally, when rubbed into the skin, the vitamin E in the oil can help promote circulation and immunity. A study in the June 2007 issue of the ""Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition"" reports that even though mustard oil is routinely used in India as a massage oil for newborns, it has the potential to be toxic to the skin. Use caution when you use it for the first time to see if your skin reacts with a rash or swelling.</p><table cellspacing=""1"" cellpadding=""1"" border=""1""><tbody><tr><td>Ingredients:                 100% Mustard Oil<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p><img src=""https://itumm.com/images/untitled%20folder/mana2.jpg?1524737283068""></p>";"";"";"";"";"GST Tax Rule 5%";"";"";"Ayurvedic Products///Oils";"<div id=""sw_elm_Benifits"" class=""pib-title cm-combination open""><em>♡  Benefits of Mustard Oil</em></div><div><ul><li>Beneficial For Asthma</li><li>Boosts Brain Function</li><li>Is A Natural Stimulant</li><li>Helps Heal Chapped Lips</li><li>Promotes Overall Health</li><li>Relieves Cold And Cough</li><li>Reduces The Risk Of Cancer</li><li>Has Cardiovascular Benefits</li><li>Eases Joint Pain And Arthritis</li><li>Improves Functioning Of The Organs</li><li>Stimulates Sensation In The Muscles</li><li>Is An Excellent Insect Repellent</li><li>Whitens Teeth And Treats Dental Problems</li><li>Has Antibacterial, Antifungal, And Anti-inflammatory Properties</li></ul></div>";"A";"P"

It is highly nourishing, healing and lubricating. Other than being used as a flavor enhancing cooking oil, it has many beauty benefits too. Sesame oil is popularly used for hair growth and to maintain scalp health. It is enriched with Vitamin E, B complex, and minerals such as magnesium, calcium, phosphorus and protein that strengthens the hair from the roots and deeply nourishes. The health benefits of sesame oil include its ability to improve hair and skin health, help in bone growth, reduce blood pressure, maintain good heart health, manage anxiety and depression, protect infant health, cure dental problems, prevent cancer, improve the digestive process, and lower inflammation. Sesame oil, which comes from sesame seeds, is a lesser-known vegetable oil but is, in fact, one of the healthiest alternatives to normal vegetable oils. Sesame oil has also been used in massages, due to its beneficial effects on the body and skin. It is a highly sought after oil, even as a carrier oil for various cosmetic products. The impressive amount of vitamins, minerals, organic compounds, and other beneficial components in sesame oil is the reason why it is considered so healthy.</p><p><strong>More Product details:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Hair Care:</strong></p><p>Sesame oil has traditionally been used to improve the health of hair. It can help retain the natural hair color and minimize hair loss. Furthermore, the antibacterial effects of sesame oil can help to eliminate the pathogens or foreign bodies that can attack your scalp or hair.</p><p><strong>2. Skin Care:</strong></p><p>Sesame oil is rich in zinc, which is one of the most important minerals for your skin. It can increase skin elasticity and smoothness, helping reduce the appearance of age spots and eliminating skin conditions, including premature aging. Sesame oil can also be used as a sunscreen because it creates a protective layer on the skin, which is another way of protecting the body from foreign substances or toxins that get in through the skin. In some places, sesame oil has even been used to treat fungal diseases on the skin.</p><p><strong>3. Protects Heart Health:</strong></p><p>Like most vegetable oils, sesame oil is helpful and delicious because of its fatty acid content. It contains a wide range of polyunsaturated fatty acids, including sesamol and sesamin. These fatty acids keep the cardiovascular system strong and the LDL cholesterol levels low. This oil can also drop the cholesterol levels that the body already has, thereby reducing atherosclerosis. This means that you are better protected from a heart attack and stroke if you add sesame oil to your diet.</p><p><strong>4. Improves Bone Quality:</strong></p><p>Copper, zinc, and calcium are the three minerals that are integral to bone growth in the body, which means that by maintaining an appropriate level of sesame oil in your diet, you can increase the rate of bone growth and development, as well as speed up any healing or regrowth of bones as well. As you get older, sesame oil can help you avoid osteoporosis and various age-related weaknesses in the bones.</p><p><strong>5. Relieves Anxiety:</strong></p><p>Tyrosine, in sesame oil, has been directly connected to serotonin activity in the brain, which can help boost the mood by flooding the body with enzymes and hormones that make a person feel happy. In other words, when you are suffering from anxiety or depression, sesame oil can give you a positive boost and turn your mood around.</p><p><strong>6. Oral Health:</strong></p><p>Sesame oil is highly recommended by dental professionals because of a process called oil pulling, which involves putting oil in your mouth and then swishing it around before spitting it out. With sesame oil, this process has been directly linked to whiter teeth, lower levels of dental plaque, and protection against certain streptococcus mutans that can make us very ill. The powerful antibacterial effects of this oil are the main reasons for this boost in dental health.</p><p><strong>7. Prevents Cancer:</strong></p><p>Sesame oil contains an organic compound called phytate, which has been directly linked to a reduction in the development of cancer. Furthermore, the magnesium level in sesame oil is unusually high, and this essential mineral is directly linked to lowered chances of colorectal cancer. The calcium content is also very beneficial for preventing colon cancer.</p><p><strong>8. Boosts Circulation & Metabolism:</strong></p><p>High copper and zinc content mean that the body is able to function at its optimal levels, mainly because copper is required for the production of red blood cells. With a significant percentage of copper in sesame oil, your body is sure to get the right amount of blood flowing to the organs and tissues, ensuring a healthier lifestyle.</p><p><strong>9. Reduces Inflammation:</strong></p><p>Copper is a natural anti-inflammatory substance and can help reduce the inflammation and discomfort of various conditions such as gout and arthritis. It reduces the swelling of joints and strengthens the bones and blood vessels, helping to keep your frame strong and sturdy for many years without any painful inflammation.</p><p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>100% Til Oil.</p><p><img src=""https://itumm.com/images/untitled%20folder/mana2.jpg?1524737283068""></p>";"";"";"";"";"GST Tax Rule 5%";"";"";"Ayurvedic Products///Oils";"<div id=""sw_elm_Benifits"" class=""pib-title cm-combination open""><em>♡  Benefits of Til Oil are</em></div><div><ul><li>As Massage Oil</li><li>As a Moisturizer</li><li>As Natural Sunscreen</li><li>As a Nutrient Source</li><li>Prevents Bacterial Infections</li><li>Repairing Damaged Skin Cells</li><li>Slows Down the Aging of Skin</li></ul></div><div id=""sw_elm_Benifits"" class=""pib-title cm-combination open""><em>♡  Some more Benefits of Til Oil for Hair are</em></div><div><ul><li>Treats Head Lice</li><li>Til Oil For Dryness</li><li>Soothing Properties</li><li>Promotes Hair Growth</li><li>Til Oil For Dandruff</li><li>Til Oil For Hair Shine</li><li>Revitalizes Damaged Hair</li><li>Treats Premature Graying</li><li>Til Oil For Deep Conditioning</li><li>Combats Hair Loss Due To Stress</li><li>Protects Hair From Harmful UV Rays</li></ul></div>";"A";"P"

Shatavari is used in Ayurveda to balance pitta and vata, but can increase kapha due to its heavy nature. &nbsp;Its bitter and sweet taste has a cooling effect on the system, and its unctuous (oily), building nature makes it a great support for anyone looking for a nourishing, grounding effect. &nbsp;It also an adaptogenic herb, said to help your body cope with physical and emotional stress.</span></p><h4 class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">More Product details:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h4><p class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Immune System Support</strong></span></p><p class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Studies show that Shatavari plays a very important role in stimulating immune cells. Shatavari is high in saponins, which are compounds with antioxidant abilities. Antioxidants help prevent free-radical cell damage. They also battle oxidative stress, which causes disease. &nbsp;It enhances the body’s resistance during normal and immunosuppressed conditions, helping to boost immunity and aiding in recovery time.

It improves digestion by increasing the activity of digestive enzymes lipase and amylase. Lipase aids fat digestion whereas amylase helps with the digestion of carbohydrates. In addition to this, Shatavari promotes gastric emptying and normalises the motility of intestines. Intestinal motility disorders are abnormal intestinal contractions, such as spasms and intestinal paralysis. The powdered dried root of shatavari has historically been used in Indian medicine to make a juice that is used to cure ulcers (small holes in the gastrointestinal tract) and gastroparesis (a condition in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents). Gastroparesis can cause heartburn, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea.</span></p><p class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Controls Hormonal Imbalances</strong></span></p><p class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Shatavari stimulates and balances the production of happy hormones; endorphins, serotonin and dopamine thus greatly reducing mood swings, irritability and menopause induced depression. &nbsp;One of traditional use of this herb is to nourish female reproductive system from within to relieve menopause symptoms such as vaginal dryness, hot flashes and insomnia. This phytoestrogen-rich herb naturally helps to balance the hormones responsible for many of the more unpleasant symptoms associated with this change in life. Shatavari has also been suggested as a stress-fighting herb that works by strengthening the immune system thereby helping the body and mind more effectively cope with challenging situations that may cause anxiety and tension.</span></p><p class=""text-justify""><strong><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">5. Aphrodisiac</span></strong></p><p class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Shatavari works as an aphrodisiac in man and women. Research shows that Shatavari increases blood flow to the female genital area, enhancing sexual sensation, sensitivity and increasing vaginal lubrication. It is known to have a hormone balancing effect, making it useful for women who experience loss of libido as a side effect of the menopause. In men it promotes the strength and stiffness of the penis, and can treat impotence and sexual debilitation.</span></p><p class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><strong>Ingredients:</strong>100% Shatavari Powder</span></p><p class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><img src=""https://itumm.com/images/untitled%20folder/mana2.jpg?1524737283068""></span></p>";"";"";"";"";"GST Tax Rule 5%";"";"";"Ayurvedic Products";"<h5 class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">♡ Benefits of Shatavari Powder are:</span></h5><ul class=""text-justify""><li class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Natural antioxidant</span></li><li class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Supports male and female reproductive systems</span></li><li class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Supports digestion</span></li><li class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Increases energy</span></li><li class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Supports immune system</span></li><li class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Supports breast milk production</span></li><li class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Controls female hormones</span></li><li class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Supports healthy bowel movements</span></li><li class=""text-justify""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Moisturizes respiratory tract</span></li></ul>";"A";"P"

As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure! Podapatri, also called Gymnema sylvestre or Gurmar, is an herb traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for treating diabetes, supporting balanced blood sugar levels and support healthy pancreas functions. This herb is normally found in the tropical forests of India and Asia. It has been safely used safely for centuries in Ayurveda (Indian herbal system) as part of the daily diet to help maintain healthy blood sugar levels and reduce sugar cravings. It appears to increase the number of insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas, while returning blood sugar levels to near normal. It increases the activity of enzymes responsible for glucose uptake and utilization.</p><p class=""text-justify""><strong>More Product details:</strong></p><p class=""text-justify""><strong>1. Treatment For Diabetes:</strong></p><p class=""text-justify"">There are many potential reasons for diabetes including stress, unhealthy eating habits, lack of physical activity, vitamin mineral deficiency, low immunity, environment toxins and heredity. Podapatri is a blood sugar balancing herb that slows the absorption of sugars into the bloodstream and slows the conversion of sugar to fat. Podapatri increases insulin production by repairing or regenerating the pancreas cells, the site of insulin production. It also abolishes the taste of sugar, which effectively suppresses and neutralizes the cravings for sweets. It is most popular benefit is to promote normal blood sugar and positively affect insulin production.</p><p class=""text-justify""><strong>2. Supports Weight Loss:</strong></p><p class=""text-justify"">Podapatri powder works as a multi-supportive therapy for weight management. Obesity is due to accumulation of fats and carbohydrates. Obesity is often genetic and common in people with diabetes. A hypothesis is that there is a common link between diabetes, gymnemic acid and obesity; and medicines useful for reducing diabetes are useful to reduce obesity. Evidence suggests that it can reduce cravings for sweets, sugar absorption during digestion, and promote normal blood sugar levels. It complements exercise and dietary reform by promoting healthy blood glucose balance. The podapatri plant contains a number of compounds, such as acidic glycosides and anthroquinones and have important value as an appetite suppressant. Gymnemic acids stops stimulation of taste buds for sweetness and thus helps prevent sugar cravings.</p><p class=""text-justify""><strong>3. Blocks Sugar Absorption:</strong></p><p class=""text-justify"">During digestion, gymnemic acids act as ‘sugar blocking’ agents. This results in reduced sugar absorption during digestion, which then helps balance blood sugar and reduce the amount of sugar that gets stored as fat. Gymnemic acids interfere with absorption of glucose in intestine and thus suppress blood glucose level.</p><p class=""text-justify""><strong>4. Nutritional Support for Diabetics:</strong></p><p class=""text-justify"">Evidence suggests that Mana Ayurvedam Podapatri Powder supplement produces increase in insulin levels. Insulin is produced in the pancreas, so it is believed that the insulin increase may be due to a regeneration of pancreatic cells.</p><p class=""text-justify""><strong>5. Reduces Cholesterol</strong></p><p class=""text-justify"">Podapatri leaves contain chemicals which avoid absorption of harmful cholesterol and triglycerides in intestine and thus results in excretion of cholesterol. Some study results indicate antiatherosclerotic potential of gymnema and its use to reduce risk of cholesterol deposition in heart arteries.</p><p class=""text-justify""><strong>Ingredients:</strong>100% Podapatri Powder</p><p class=""text-justify""><img src=""https://itumm.com/images/untitled%20folder/mana2.jpg?1524737283068""></p>";"";"";"";"";"GST Tax Rule 5%";"";"";"Ayurvedic Products";"<div id=""sw_elm_Benifits"" class=""pib-title cm-combination open""><em>♡  Benefits of Podapatri Powder</em></div><div><ul><li>Treats diabetes</li><li>Treats arthritis</li><li>Acts as diuretic</li><li>Treats constipation</li><li>Controls blood sugar</li><li>Supports weight loss</li><li>Helps to prevent diabetes</li><li>Supports pancreas functions</li><li>Treats bronchitis and cough</li><li>Controls insulin production</li><li>Anti-inflammatory properties</li><li>Cures minor digestive issues</li><li>Removes intestinal parasites and worms</li></ul></div>";"A";"P"

For centuries, aloe vera has been renowned as a medicinal herb that is widely used in the cosmetic and the alternative medicine industry.

Sunburn Treatment:</strong></p><p>Use aloe vera soap for treating your sunburn. It acts on the epithelial skin layer and provides a protective layer to the skin to retain moisture. Since aloe vera contains a lot of antioxidants and nutritional properties, the skin is able to prevent the moisture from escaping, which in turn heals the sunburn quickly.</p><p><strong>2. Prevents Aging:</strong></p><p>As we age, our skin develops fine lines, wrinkles, and loose skin.

It can help your skin from drying up. It also treats itching skin..</p><p><strong>4. Reduces Stretch Marks:</strong></p><p>With the passing of age, our skin expands and contracts just like elastic. When the skin stretches very far, like during the pregnancy or due to rapid weight gain, the elasticity of the skin gets damaged, which results in ugly stretch marks. These marks are nothing but small tears on the skin layers, which can be healed with regular use of aloe vera soap.</p><p><strong>5. Relieves Allergies</strong></p><p>Aloe vera is also known to have anti allergic and anti inflammatory properties. Using aloe vera soap regularly can give you a smooth skin. It will also keep allergies at bay.</p><p><strong>6. Other Nutrients In Aloe Vera Soap</strong></p><p>Aloe vera soap comes loaded with several nutrients like glycerin, sodium palmate, sodium carbonate, sodium palm kemelate, sorbitol, etc. These are good for the skin and nourish your skin from within, giving you the skin that glows with health.</p><p><strong>7.

Brahmi is a Sanskrit word that refers to the feminine essence of universal consciousness as well as the creative potential that emerges from pure awareness. Both of the herbs that bear the name brahmi are thought to promote subtle awareness and <em>sattva</em> (the pure essence of consciousness). They are also both highly revered for their mind-enhancing properties and their support of the nervous system as a whole. This article will focus on highlighting the primary applications of each of these herbs, as well as some useful distinctions between them.</p><p>To some extent, the dual use of the name brahmi can be understood by simple geography; in southern India, ""brahmi"" refers to <em>Bacopa monnieri</em>, and in Northern India, it is <em>Centella asiatica</em> that is commonly known as ""brahmi."" In the west, <em>Centella asiatica</em> is also widely known by its Singhalese name, ""gotu kola.""<a href=""https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/living-ayurveda/herbs/brahmi/#references"">1</a> To make matters even more complicated, each of these herbs has two Latin binomial names; <em>Centella asiatica </em>is synonymous with <em>Hydrocotyle asiatica</em> and <em>Bacopa monnieri</em> is synonymous with <em>Herpestes monniera</em>. The fact that these two herbs have very similar actions only adds to the confusion that exists around them. Hopefully, the information that follows will offer some clarity. In the interest of simplicity, we will refer here to <em>Centella asiatica</em> as ""gotu kola"" and <em>Bacopa monnieri</em> as ""bacopa."" Honoring the fact that both of these herbs have legendary effects on the mind and consciousness, we will use ""brahmi,"" to refer to both them&mdash;in reference to the actions and benefits that they share. Banyan Botanicals carries both gotu kola and bacopa in bulk and they are each important ingredients in a number of Banyan products. While it’s true that the names of these two herbs vary between teachers and geographic regions, the founders of Banyan Botanicals were educated in a tradition that reserves the name ""brahmi"" for gotu kola (<em>Centella asiatica</em>), and therefore offers this herb as ""Brahmi/Gotu Kola."" Banyan offers <em>Bacopa monnieri</em> as ""Bacopa/Herpestis.""<br></p><p>Both gotu kola and bacopa pacify vata, pitta, and kapha. In excess, either one may increase vata.  Both herbs have a strong affinity for the lymph, blood, nervous tissue, and urinary tract, as well as the circulatory, digestive, and nervous systems. In addition, gotu kola works on the muscle, adipose, and bone tissues whereas bacopa resonates with all of the tissues in the body as well as the channels of elimination. And while some describe bacopa as cooling, others insist that it is in fact, heating&mdash;though still calming to pitta. Relative to gotu kola, let’s just say that bacopa is less cooling and may therefore be preferred in certain types of vata and kapha imbalances. Gotu kola will generally be the better choice where there are strong indications of pitta imbalance. This is, of course, a subtle distinction because both herbs are considered to be <em>tridoshic</em> (balancing to vata, pitta, and kapha) and for specific conditions one may be preferred over the other. Bacopa is likely more suited for overall strengthening, and energy promotion. Gotu kola is purifying and rejuvenating&mdash;especially for pitta. Both are said to support longevity.,  Gotu kola is an appetizer while bacopa suppresses the appetite; bacopa is therefore often taken with digestives such as ginger or cardamom.  In addition to the benefits described below, both herbs known as brahmi are very supportive of the joints&mdash;clearing toxins while promoting comfort and freedom of movement.<br></p><p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-9dd2582d-f659-d876-4d45-c715f1aaef89""><br></span></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"">Consistently using Mana Ayurveda’s Brahmi Powder helps to</p><ul><li dir=""ltr"">Open and clarify the mind</li><li dir=""ltr"">Strengthen memory and intellect</li><li dir=""ltr"">Support focus and concentration</li><li dir=""ltr"">Encourage a balanced emotional state</li><li dir=""ltr"">Promote daytime energy and nighttime sleep</li><li dir=""ltr"">Support healthy blood cells</li><li dir=""ltr""><span></span>Promote healthy skin and hair</li></ul><p>Avoid this herb if there are known allergies to Brahmi products or other members of the Figwort family.

Neeli, sometimes called Avuri or Indigo powder, is made by powdering the leaves of indigo plant whose botanical name is Indigofera Tinctoria. Though indigo is known mainly as a natural dye, it has other amazing hair benefits too. Indigo is mainly used in the form of hair oil for stimulating hair growth and in the form of a pack for dyeing the hair. Indigo dye is an organic compound with a distinctive blue color. Historically, indigo was a natural dye extracted from the leaves of certain plants, and this process was important economically because blue dyes were once rare.</p><p><strong>More Product details:</strong></p><p><strong>1.
